SILC Toolkit 1.1.12 2014-05-13
==============================

This version adds support for associating the client or server entry
with the public key verification callback allowing application to
show more information about the entity whose public key it is
verifying.

This version also fixes some minor bugs.


SILC Toolkit 1.1.11 2014-05-06
==============================

This version introduces a new default private message key protection
method by auto-negotiating private message key with SILC Key Exchange
protocol over the SILC network, client-to-client.  The SKE is executed
by encapsulating it inside private messages.  SKE results into secret
shared key between the two clients and all private messages are protected
with that key.  This provides complete end-to-end protection for private
messages even if the SILC servers cannot be trusted.

SILC Client Library will auto-negotiate the key when private message is
sent for the first time.  Both users will be prompted to accept each others
public keys and once accpeted they are cached and subsequent verification
will be done automatically.

SILC Client Library automatically detects, within seconds, if the remote
client does not support the new method.  User will receive a notification
on screen telling that the private messages will be protected using normal
session keys instead.  This may happen also if an error occurs during
the key exchange protocol.

This feature is totally transparent and applications usually will not
require any changes to get it working.  For most cases it should work
out of the box without modifications to the application.

This version also adds a new say() client operation associated context
which can be fetched from the SilcClientConnection entry.  The associated
context can be SilcClientEntry, SilcChannelEntry or SilcServerEntry and
is meant to allow application to better target the say() operation.

This version also enables higher security message payloads by including
the Client Ids in the MAC computation.  Support for this has existed for
long time but it is now finally enabled.

This version also adds various improvement to the SILC Key Exchange
Library and the SILC Core Library.
