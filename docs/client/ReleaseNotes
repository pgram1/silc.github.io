SILC Client 1.1.10 2014-05-06
=============================

This version introduces a new default private message key protection
method by auto-negotiating private message key with SILC Key Exchange
protocol over the SILC network, client-to-client.  The SKE is executed
by encapsulating it inside private messages.  SKE results into secret
shared key between the two clients and all private messages are protected
with that key.  This provides complete end-to-end protection for private
messages even if the SILC servers cannot be trusted.

SILC Client will auto-negotiate the key when private message is sent
for the first time.  Both users will be prompted to accept each others
public keys and once accpeted they are cached and subsequent verification
will be done automatically.  It is important to verify the public key
to avoid the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks.

SILC Client automatically detects, within seconds, if the remote client
does not support the new method.  User will receive a notification on
screen telling that the private messages will be protected using normal
session keys instead.  This may happen also if an error occurs during
the key exchange protocol.

This version also fixes numerous bugs that have been found using static
analysis tools.
